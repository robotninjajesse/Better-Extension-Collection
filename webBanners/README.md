# webBanners
This folder contains the raw data of all banners used. This is for faster loading time, as the .zip extension that's used is significantly slower compared to just fetching the images from github.

The desktop version does not use this feature when not connected to the internet but instead uses the banners included in the EXTENSIONS.zip file.
