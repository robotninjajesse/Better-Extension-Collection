# Better Extension Collection
The Better Extension Collection contains extensions for TurboWarp, Penguinmod, and some other Scratch mods and contains almost every extension ever uploaded, this way you never have to search through 20 different collections to find the one you need. \n
extensions list.zip contains the files of ALL extensions. \n
extensionData.json contains overwrite data for extensions where there isn't a description, title, or author included in the file, but also links for all extension banners. \n
