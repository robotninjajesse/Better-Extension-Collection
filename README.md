# Better Extension Collection
![Better Extension Collection](https://github.com/robotninjajesse/Better-Extension-Collection/blob/main/BECicon.png)  

The [Better Extension Collection](http://robotninjajesse.github.io/Better-Extension-Collection) contains extensions for [TurboWarp](https://turbowarp.org), [Penguinmod](https://penguinmod.com), and some other Scratch mods. It contains almost every extension ever uploaded, this way you never have to search through 20 different collections to find the one you need.

[extensions list.zip](https://github.com/robotninjajesse/Better-Extension-Collection/blob/main/extensions%20list.zip) contains the .js files of ALL extensions.  
[extensionData.json](https://github.com/robotninjajesse/Better-Extension-Collection/blob/main/extensionData.json) contains overwrite data for extensions where there isn't a description, title, or author included in the file, but also links for all extension banners.
